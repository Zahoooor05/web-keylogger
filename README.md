# 🧠 Web-Based Keylogger (Ethical Demo)

## 📌 Project Description

This is a simple *web-based keylogger* that captures and logs every keystroke typed into a webpage. It demonstrates how front-end JavaScript can be used with a Python Flask backend to simulate keystroke logging in a safe, controlled way.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. *Frontend*
   - HTML page with a <textarea> for input
   - JavaScript listens for all keydown events
   - Each keystroke is sent via fetch() to the backend as JSON

2. *Backend*
   - Flask server receives POST requests at /log
   - Each keystroke is logged to logs.txt with a timestamp

3. *Output*
   - A local file (logs.txt) that records key presses in real-time
